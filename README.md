neuralnet.jl
============

Simple neural net implementation in Julia

Julia is a scientific computing language designed to be highly optimizable. To that point, Julia's reference implementation contains a JIT that can speed typical Julia code to more than half the speed of native code. This neural net implementation was written by me to make use of this incredible computing speed in a resource-intensive program. 

Since this is a personal project rather than one of great significance, I'm not being hard and fast as to what I'm implementing. 
(I've decided to contribute to https://github.com/anj1/NeuralNets.jl now that I've reinvented the wheel once, so that rather than having 2 semi-decent wheels, we have 1 excellent wheel. I'll still merge contributions, but don't expect anything from me in this repository.)
